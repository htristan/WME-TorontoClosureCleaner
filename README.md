# WME-TorontoClosureCleaner
This script is designed to help senior editors managing closures that are being fed from the City of Toronto into the Waze map and causing some chaos. The script is designed to help editors on WME find and filter their current map area for closures that match the following criteria:

-Matches a specific keyword filter in the closure reason - currently set to "Toronto-TMC"
-Has a provider of the closure set to "City of Toronto"
-Is not already finished

One button will display matching closures for inspection. Another button will attempt to auto-delete all of the matching closures.

You require closure management permissions (obviously) in the map area you are editing in order to use this script in WME.
